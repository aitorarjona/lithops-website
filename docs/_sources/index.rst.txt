------------

**Lithops is a Python multi-cloud serverless computing framework. It allows to run unmodified local python code at massive scale in the main serverless computing platforms.**

Lithops delivers the user‚Äôs code into the cloud without requiring knowledge of how it is deployed and run.
Moreover, its multicloud-agnostic architecture ensures portability across cloud providers, overcoming vendor lock-in.

------------

**Lithops provides great value for data-intensive applications like Big Data analytics and embarrassingly parallel jobs.**

It is specially suited for highly-parallel programs with little or no need for communication between processes.

Examples of applications that run with Lithops include Monte Carlo simulations, deep learning and machine learning processes, metabolomics computations, and geospatial
analytics, to name a few.

------------

**Lithops facilitates consuming data from object storage (like AWS S3, GCP Storage or IBM Cloud Object Storage) by providing automatic partitioning and data discovery for common data formats like CSV.**

Lithops abstracts away the underlying cloud-specific APIs for accessing storage and provides an intuitive and easy to use interface to process high volumes of data.


Quick Start
***********

Lithops is available for Python 3.6 and up. Install it using ``pip``:

.. code-block::

    pip install -U lithops

You're ready to execute a simple example!

.. code:: python

    from lithops import FunctionExecutor

    def hello(name):
        return 'Hello {}!'.format(name)

    with FunctionExecutor() as fexec:
        fut = fexec.call_async(hello, 'World')
        print(fut.result())

Use any Cloud
*************
**Lithops provides an extensible backend architecture that is designed to work with different compute and storage services available on Cloud providers and on-premise backends.**

In this sense, you can code your application in Python and run it unmodified wherever your data is located at: IBM Cloud, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba Aliyun...

Execution Modes
***************
Lithops ships with 3 different modes of execution. The execution mode allows you to decide where and how the functions are executed.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Localhost Mode
     - Serverless Mode
     - Standalone Mode
   * - Run functions in your local machine, by using processes. This is the default mode of execution if no configuration is provided.
     - Run functions by using public FaaS services, such as IBM Cloud Functions or Amazon Lambda. In this mode of execution, each function invocation equals to a parallel task running in the cloud in an isolated environment.
     - Run functions by using one or multiple Virtual machines (VM), either in a private cluster or in the cloud. In each VM, functions run using parallel processes.
